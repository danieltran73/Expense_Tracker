Current effort:
- Saving weekly records to txt files
- Logging individual data record
- Deal with more entry error
- Add feature to edit the expenses
- Make UX/UI

Logging/recording scope:
- Separate summary text files and weekly individual csv files, organised into months
- Text files consist of weekly summary
- Csv file consist of individual changes with the amount of the month
- Text files are put into a folder, with title from starting date to ending date of the weekly
- Csv file is one single csv file, separated into year
- Folder nest:
    - Log files folder
        - Year folder
            - Text files folder
            - One csv file

Logging/recording process
- Create year folder if non existent whenever a change in the database happen
- Write into csv file all individual increments and deductions
- Whenever increment all, save 'increment_all' outputs to a text file

CSV file data record format: Time, Date, Message, Amount
